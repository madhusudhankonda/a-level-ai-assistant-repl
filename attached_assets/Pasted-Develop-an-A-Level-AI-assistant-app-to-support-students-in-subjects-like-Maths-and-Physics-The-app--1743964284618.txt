Develop an A-Level AI assistant app to support students in subjects like Maths and Physics. The app will have two primary modules: Admin and User.

Admin Module Requirements:
1. Data Loading & Preparation:
    * Load pre-existing question papers and corresponding mark schemes from a local data folder.
    * Each question paper contains questions that are pre-clipped as PNG images (e.g., “703866-q1.png”).
2. Image Clipping & Storage:
    * Process each question paper by clipping individual questions into separate PNG images.
    * Save the PNGs in a sub-folder named after the question paper.
    * Ensure every PNG is uniquely keyed to its respective question.
3. Automated Answer Generation:
    * For each clipped question, invoke GPT-4o to generate an answer that aligns with the loaded mark scheme.
    * Map each question (via its PNG) to the corresponding generated answer.
4. Key Mapping & Logging:
    * Create a comprehensive key map linking the question paper, its PNG images, and the generated answers.
    * Log a confirmation message once the entire process (clipping, answer generation, and key mapping) is complete.

User Module Requirements:
1. User Interface & Navigation:
    * Provide a clean, responsive interface where students can select a question paper from a list.
    * Display the selected questions centrally on a canvas as PNG images.
2. Interactive Features:
    * Allow students to attempt solving questions offline.
    * For each question, offer two interactive options:
        * Show Answer:
            * A button that, when clicked, immediately reveals the pre-generated answer.
        * Explain Answer:
            * A button that triggers GPT-4o to provide a clear, succinct explanation of the answer.
            * The explanation should be detailed enough to help the student understand the underlying concepts.

Technical & Development Guidelines:
* Modular Architecture:
    * Develop separate modules for the admin and user functionalities to ensure scalability and ease of future updates.
* Local Data Management:
    * Securely access and manage the local data folder containing question papers and mark schemes.
* LLM Integration:
    * Integrate GPT-4o for both initial answer generation (admin module) and on-demand answer explanations (user module).
* Error Handling & Logging:
    * Implement robust error handling and logging to monitor processing and user interactions.
* Documentation & Maintainability:
    * Write clear, maintainable code with comprehensive inline documentation.
    * Provide deployment instructions and user guides for troubleshooting and updates.
* Security Measures:
    * Incorporate basic security practices to protect local data (especially mark schemes) from unauthorized access.
* Extensibility:
    * Design the app to be easily extended to include additional subjects or functionalities in the future.

Deliverables:
* Complete source code for the A-Level AI assistant app.
* Detailed deployment instructions.
* Documentation outlining the architecture and structure of both admin and user modules.
* Test cases or guidelines to verify functionalities such as image clipping, answer generation, and interactive user responses.
